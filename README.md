# **GDSC 2023 Solution Challenge**

>Note: <br> we don't have a provided code since we unexpected issues right before the deadline so we gave up :( <br> but when we heard that the deadline was extended and we could submit a video for just our idea without the code at the moment, we were motivated that we have a chance <br> and if we were accepeted and qualified we can work on our app later. <br> and Thanks for you understanding :)

## Solution "Food Rescue"

## Description: 

We aim to help people in need and provide them with food and supplies from stores and restaurants that overflow their daily output instead of throwing it away for waste.

> Our app will have 3 users: the donor/supplier (ex: restaurant), the charity, the charity volunteers

<br>

## Here's a brief description of how it will work:
the supplier (whether it's a restaurant or any other store) will state that he has extra resources left

Now the charity organizers will get notified every time a supplier states an announcement and will start choosing where to go and select one of the suppliers

A charity volunteer is then set to go (he/she will be guided by google maps to the location) and receive the resources given, then the charity will organize it up and provide it to the right people according to their system
